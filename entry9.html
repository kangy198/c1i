      <h2>Crisis & Recovery</h2>
    </header>

      <header id="body-text">
       <h3>
        This stage can technically occur at any time or during any other stage. However, due to its advanced nature, this is generally considered the final stage of any relationship. A crisis could include an illness, job loss, death in the family, or even an affair. Recovery lies in resisting the urge to take your frustrations and problems out on one another and instead each taking on the roles of caretaker and patient alike. A crisis can be draining for everyone involved, therefore it’s important that you’re willing to both give and receive support.

        In truth, sometimes a crisis does mark the end of a relationship — whether it be through damaged trust or simply a change in one or both people’s needs. That’s okay, and does not diminish all the love that came before. However, the good news is that if you recover, you will have gained valuable team-building experience, and you can move back into one of the other stages with the assurance that you’ll be better prepared for any other crises that arise.

        This is what most people think of when they imagine young love. The birds are chirping, the glass is half full, and the “love” chemicals (such as dopamine and phenylethylamine) are flowing, making you feel happy, invincible, and like you’re on top of the world. This stage often begins on the first date, and it ends the day that you see your person of interest for who they really are (good or bad). To move past this honeymoon stage, don’t allow the “high” to cloud your judgment about the person you’re dating. That is to say, don’t let it enchant you into staying with an incompatible partner. Many broken hearts have their roots in a dysfunction from this stage, belonging to lovers who missed or ignored the writing on the wall.
